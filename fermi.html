        <h1>The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</h1>
        <p>
            The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, commonly known as Fermi, is a pivotal space observatory developed by NASA to study the universe in the gamma-ray spectrum. Launched in 2008, Fermi has been instrumental in probing the most energetic phenomena in the cosmos, from supermassive black holes to pulsars and gamma-ray bursts.

        <p>
            Gamma rays, being the highest-energy form of light, provide unique insights into the extreme processes of the universe. Fermi's Large Area Telescope (LAT) and its Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) work in tandem to scan the entire sky every three hours, capturing a comprehensive view of the gamma-ray universe. This has allowed Fermi to detect thousands of gamma-ray sources and provide crucial data on phenomena like active galactic nuclei, supernova remnants, and neutron stars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, Fermi has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including insights into the nature of gamma-ray bursts, the detection of a new class of gamma-ray-only pulsars, and mapping the gamma-ray glow at the center of our galaxy. With an initial mission cost of approximately $690 million, Fermi's contributions to high-energy astrophysics have been invaluable. As it continues its observations, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope stands as a testament to our drive to understand the universe's most energetic and mysterious events.
