        <h1>The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA)</h1>
        <p>
            The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, commonly referred to as SOFIA, is a unique collaboration between NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Unlike traditional space observatories, SOFIA operates aboard a modified Boeing 747SP aircraft, flying at altitudes between 39,000 to 45,000 feet, above most of Earth's water vapor that blocks infrared wavelengths from reaching the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
            Launched into operation in 2010, SOFIA's primary instrument is a 2.7-meter reflecting telescope, which observes the universe in the infrared spectrum. This airborne observatory offers a distinct advantage: it can be returned to the ground for maintenance, upgrades, and the integration of new instruments, ensuring it remains at the forefront of infrared astronomy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, SOFIA has made numerous significant discoveries, from capturing the first-ever images of a nascent planetary system to detecting atomic oxygen in the Martian atmosphere. With an operational cost of approximately $85 million annually, SOFIA continues to provide invaluable insights into the cosmos. Its unique design and capabilities underscore the innovative spirit of human exploration and our relentless pursuit of knowledge about the universe.
