        <h1>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)</h1>
        <p>
            The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, more commonly known as TESS, is a NASA mission specifically designed to search for exoplanets. Launched in 2018, TESS's primary goal is to identify planets orbiting nearby stars using the transit method, where the minute dimming of starlight due to a planet passing in front of its host star is observed.
        </p>
        <p>
            TESS's unique observational strategy involves scanning almost the entire sky, focusing on the brightest and closest stars. This approach ensures that the exoplanets TESS discovers are both well-suited for detailed follow-up observations and for investigations into their potential habitability. Its wide-field cameras cover a sky area 400 times larger than that observed by the Kepler mission, making TESS's survey one of the most comprehensive searches for nearby exoplanets to date.
        </p>
        <p>
            While TESS's mission was initially slated for two years, its success and the wealth of data it provides have opened discussions for extensions. With a development and launch cost of approximately $287 million, TESS has already proven its value by identifying numerous exoplanet candidates, some of which are of significant interest for further study. As TESS continues its survey, it reinforces our drive to find other worlds and deepens our understanding of the universe and our place within it.
