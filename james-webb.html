        <h1>The James Webb Space Telescope</h1>
        <p>
            The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is hailed as the next-generation space observatory, designed to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope. Set to be launched in 2021, the JWST promises to revolutionize our understanding of the universe, with capabilities that far exceed its predecessors. It is specifically designed to capture images in infrared light, allowing it to peer through cosmic dust and observe distant phenomena with unprecedented clarity.

            Unlike Hubble, which orbits the Earth, the JWST will be positioned at the second Lagrange Point (L2), nearly 1.5 million kilometers away from our planet. This unique position offers a stable observational platform and minimizes interference from Earth's atmosphere and thermal radiation. The JWST is expected to shed light on some of the most profound questions in astronomy, from the formation of the first galaxies and stars to the potential habitability of exoplanets.

            Developing the James Webb Space Telescope has been a monumental endeavor, both in terms of technology and finances. Its estimated cost is around $10 billion, making it one of the most expensive space missions ever undertaken. Despite the challenges and costs, the potential scientific returns from the JWST are immeasurable. As it embarks on its mission, the JWST stands as a beacon of human ingenuity and our relentless pursuit of knowledge about the cosmos.
